// The Basic Calculator (25 points)

// In this part of the assignment you will build a simple calculator using the skills you’ve acquired in regards to functions. You will ask the user for a number, a second number, and then finally ask them what kind of operation they want to perform, either add, subtract, multiply, or divide. Depending on what they select, you will perform that operation. To complete this part of the assignment follow the steps outlined here:

//     Create a function that will serve as the main calculation logic of your application. This function should be called calculate and will accept three parameters: x, y, and operation.
//     In the script, prompt the user for a number and store that in a variable. Convert that to a number.
//     Then, prompt the user for a second number and store that in a variable. Convert that to a number.
//     Next, prompt the user for the operation they would like to perform (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and store that in a variable.
//     Finally, pass the three parameters into the calculate function to return the result of the calculation. You'll need to add a switch statement inside the calculate function to evaluate the operation and perform the appropriate calculation on the x and y numbers based on the operation passed in. 
//     Display the result of the calculation within an alert.
//     Figure out how to make it so that if the user doesn’t enter either add, subtract, multiply, or divide, they are displayed an alert message telling them that. Then you’ll have to rerun the application so that the application asks the user for the numbers and operation once more. You’ll have to add this functionality within a do while loop similarly how the labs were done in the previous lecture.


calculate = function(x, y, operation) {
    let result;
    if (operation === "+") {
        result = x + y;
    }
    else if (operation === "-") {
        result = x - y;
    }
    else if (operation === "*") {
        result = x * y;
    }
    else if (operation === "/") {
        if (y === 0) {
            alert("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.");
            throw new Error("Division by zero");
        }
        result = x / y;
    }
    else {
        alert("Invalid operation! Please use +, -, *, or /.");
        throw new Error("Invalid operation");
    }
    return result;
}

let firstNum = parseFloat(prompt("Enter the first number:"));
let secondNum = parseFloat(prompt("Enter the second number:"));
let operation = prompt("Enter the operation to perform (+, -, *, /):");
let calculationResult = calculate(firstNum, secondNum, operation);
alert("The result of " + firstNum + " " + operation + " " + secondNum + " is: " + calculationResult);
